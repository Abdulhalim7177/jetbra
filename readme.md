# Jetbra
A tool designed for JetBrains family products, inspired by [Reol's project](https://jetbra.in/s), I wrote some code myself, and the usage is consistent with that project. 
Before replacing janetfilter, you need to execute the uninstall script for janetfilter.

New [Tampermonkey script](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/480799-jetbra) is available. This script can generate activation codes for the plugin and must be used in conjunction with this tool.
